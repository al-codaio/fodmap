# FODMAPs database with CodaPHP
This is a test using @[danielstieber](https://github.com/danielstieber)'s [CodaPHP](https://github.com/danielstieber/CodaPHP) library. 

I took a simple list of FODMAP foods (learn more about FODMAPs [here](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/fodmaps-101)), entered them into this [Coda doc](https://coda.io/d/FODMAP-Database_dBvPGe-8_sj/Data_subMF#FODMAP-Database_tu8WA/r290), and built a static website deployed via Heroku [here](https://dry-stream-79082.herokuapp.com/).
